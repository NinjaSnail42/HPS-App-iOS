# HPS App iOS
Repository for the HPS App for iOS.
I started this app in April of 2013.  It has gone through several iterations throughout my High School carrer, and work on this project
has slowed due to college.  It has been optimized to be able to be updated through the web (replacing files on a specific url with newer
ones) so that the tech coordinator can easily update it.

Installation:
The app can be found on the Apple App Store.  It is named HPS App.
