# HPS App iOS
Repository for the HPS App for iOS.
I started this app in April of 2013.  It has gone through several iterations throughout my High School carrer, and work on this project
has slowed due to college.  It has been optimized to be able to be updated through the web (replacing files on a specific url with newer
ones) so that the tech coordinator can easily update it.

Installation:
As of now, the app is no longer available. Due to having nobody to fill my shoes after leaving high school, the app was removed from the App Store and they have gone with an outside company to develop their mobile application.
